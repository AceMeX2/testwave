 Apache Wave lets you communicate and collaborate in real time
</span>

  <b>Wave is equal parts conversation and document.</b>
  People can communicate and work together with richly formatted text,
  gadgets, robots and more.

<p>
  <b>Wave is shared.</b> Any participant can reply anywhere in the message,
  edit the content and add participants at any point in the process.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Wave is live.</b>
  With live transmission as you type, participants on a wave can have faster
  conversations, see edits and interact with extensions in real-time.
